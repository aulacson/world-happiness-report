###### Context

The World Happiness Report is a measure of the state of global happiness. Using data from the Gallup World Poll, various quality of life factors (i.e. economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity) were used to estimate the happiness scores and rankings of each country. Findings from this report are used to inform multiple governments and organizations of policy-making decisions, as well as aid experts in the assessment of a nation's progress.
